    The typical usage of create_engine() is once per particular database URL, 
    held globally for the lifetime of a single application process. A single 
    Engine manages many individual DBAPI connections on behalf of the process 
    and is intended to be called upon in a concurrent fashion. The Engine is 
    not synonymous to the DBAPI connect function, which represents just one 
    connection resource - the Engine is most efficient when created just once 
    at the module level of an application, not per-object or per-function call.

    The most basic function of the Engine is to provide access to a Connection, 
    which can then invoke SQL statements. To emit a textual statement to the 
    database looks like:
